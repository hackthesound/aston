<p> <h2>Good mental health is very important to the human mind.<h2> </p><img src="download.jpg" alt="depressedkid" />
 <ol><li><h2>Eating</h2></li><p>Bad mental health can cause bad eating habits.</p>
   <li><h2>Stress</h2></li><p>Large amounts of stress will cause bad mental health when not handled well.</p>
   <li><h2>What should I do if someone I know fits this criteria?</h2></li><p> If someone has bad mental health, it can affect them badly physically as well.
   You should also check if you fit this criteria and if you do maybe go to a therapist and have them give you advice.</p>
   <li><h2>DISCLAIMER</h2></li><p> Now make sure you understand that even if someone fits this criteria, it doesn't mean that they are depressed or have other mental related issues. 
     It does increase the chances of them having depression probably, but you won't truly know until you go and talk to them.</p> </ol>
