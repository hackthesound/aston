<p> <h2>Mental Health is very important, and when it comes down to people who are depressed or not feeling well it becomes something that people really need to pay attention to.<h2> </p>
 <ol><h2>Hunger</h2></p><p>Something that people tend to overlook when it comes to mental health is hunger. If you pay attention someone might not be eating well and skipping breakfast, lunch, and even dinner maybe.
This is a common sign that someone isn't mentally doing well. Of course its not the only sign that means someone is depressed or has mental issues. </p>
  <li><h2>Introvert and Extrovert</h2></li> <p> A introvert is someone who doesn't socialize much. A extrovert is the opposite of a introvert. A extrovert is someone who socializes alot. 
    Someone whos depressed might be in the introvert category because someone whos depressed might not want to socialize much.</p>
   <li><h2>Stress</h2></li> <p> Have you ever been worried about a project? Maybe a project at school thats due the next day? Maybe its due the next day and you haven't even started yet? Are your worried?
   If you are, thats called stress. Someone whos depressed probably has high levels of stress. This could be from school, connections/realationships with others, and other things.</p>
   <li><h2>What should I do if someone I know fits this criteria?</h2></li><p> If you know someone close to you who fits this criteria then maybe you should go have a one on one talk with them to see if there okay.
   You should also check if you fit this criteria and if you do maybe go to a therapist and have them give you advice.</p>
   <li><h2>DISCLAIMER</h2></li><p> Now make sure you understand that even if someone fits this criteria, it doesn't mean that they are depressed or have other mental related issues. 
     Does it increase the chances of them having depression probably, but you won't truly know until you go and talk to them.</p> </ol>
