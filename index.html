<p> <h2>Mental health is very important, and when it comes down to people who are depressed or not feeling well it becomes something that people really need to pay attention to. There is also depression.<h2> </p><img src="download.jpg" alt="depressedkid" />
 <ol><h2>Hunger</h2></p><p>Something that people tend to overlook when it comes to mental health is hunger. Someone may not be eating well and skipping meals.
This is a common sign that someone isn't mentally doing well. Of course, it's not the only sign that means someone is depressed or has mental issues. </p>
  <li><h2>Introvert and Extrovert</h2></li> <p> A introvert is someone who doesn't socialize much. A extrovert is the opposite of a introvert. A extrovert is someone who socializes a lot. 
    Someone who's depressed might be in the introvert category. This is because someone who is depressed might not want to socialize much.</p>
   <li><h2>Stress</h2></li><p> Have you ever been worried about a project? Maybe a project at school thats due the next day? Maybe it's due the next day and you haven't even started yet?</p>
   If you are, that's called stress. Someone who's depressed can have high levels of stress. This could be from school, connections/relationships with others, and extracurricular ectivities like sports.</p>
   <li><h2>What should I do if someone I know fits this criteria?</h2></li><p> If you know someone close to you who has bad mental health, then maybe you should go have a one on one talk with them to see if they're okay.
   You should also check if you fit this criteria and if you do maybe go to a therapist and have them give you advice.</p>
   <li><h2>DISCLAIMER</h2></li><p> Now make sure you understand that even if someone fits this criteria, it doesn't mean that they are depressed or have other mental related issues. 
     It does increase the chances of them having depression probably, but you won't truly know until you go and talk to them.</p> </ol>
