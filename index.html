    <p> <h2>Mental health is very important, and when it comes down to people who are depressed or not feeling well it becomes something that people really need to pay attention to. There is also depression.</h2></p>
      <ol><li><h2>Eating Habits<h2></li><button type="button">+1 Food</button></p><p>Something that people tend to overlook when it comes to mental health is hunger. Someone may not be eating well and skipping meals. This is a common sign that someone isn't mentally doing well.</p>
     <li><h2>Stress</h2></li><button type="button">-1 Stress</button><p>Someone who's depressed can have high levels of stress. This could be from school, connections/relationships with others, and extracurricular ectivities like sports.</p>
     <li><h2>What should I do if someone I know fits this criteria?</h2></li><p> If you know someone close to you who has bad mental health, then maybe you should go have a one on one talk with them to see if they're okay. You should also check if you fit this criteria and if you do maybe go to a therapist and have them give you advice.</p>
